# Image Classification Project

## Description
This project is an image classification system that identifies objects or patterns within images. It utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze and categorize images into predefined classes. Image classification has various applications, including object detection, medical diagnosis, and facial recognition.

## How to Use
To use this image classification system, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. This may include Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and any other required libraries. You can install dependencies using `pip` or `conda`.

3. **Dataset Preparation**: Prepare your dataset by organizing images into respective class folders. Ensure a balanced distribution of images across classes for optimal training.

4. **Training**: Train the image classification model using the provided script or notebook. Fine-tune the model architecture and hyperparameters as needed to achieve desired performance.

5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model's performance using validation or test data. Measure metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess classification performance.

6. **Inference**: Once trained, use the model to classify new images. Provide input images to the model and observe the predicted classes as output.

## Features
